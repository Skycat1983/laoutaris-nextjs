# Shop Route Reconstruction Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

Reconstructed the shop route to **exactly match the working artwork route pattern**, eliminating the runtime crash.

---

## üèóÔ∏è New Architecture (Mirroring Artwork Route)

### 1. `/shop/products/page.tsx` (Server Component)

- Parses URL `searchParams`
- Creates `filters` object from search params
- Renders banner (static HTML)
- Renders `<ShopProductsLoader>` with initial filters

### 2. `ShopProductsLoader.tsx` (Server Component - NEW)

**Location:** `src/components/loaders/viewLoaders/ShopProductsLoader.tsx`

- Async server component
- Builds query params from `initialFilters`
- Fetches from `/api/v2/shop/products` during SSR
- Handles errors gracefully
- Renders `<ShopProductGallery>` with fetched products

### 3. `ShopProductGallery.tsx` (Client Component - NEW)

**Location:** `src/components/compositions/ShopProductGallery.tsx`

- `"use client"` directive
- Receives: `initialProducts`, `initialFilters`
- Uses `useState` (initialized from props)
- `handleFilterChange`: Async function, fetches explicitly (NO `useEffect`)
- `clearFilters`: Resets to initial products
- Renders: `<ShopFilters>` + `<ShopResultsBar>` + Product Grid

### 4. `shopTypes.ts` (Type Definitions - NEW)

**Location:** `src/lib/data/types/shopTypes.ts`

- `ShopFiltersState`: Filter state type
- `ShopSearchParams`: URL search params type

### 5. `ShopFilters.tsx` (Updated)

- Now accepts `filters` prop and `onFilterChange` callback
- No internal state (parent manages it)
- Uses `|| fallback` for optional values
- Uses `?? true` for checkboxes

## üîÑ Data Flow (Now Matches Artwork Route)

```
1. User visits /shop/products
   ‚Üì
2. page.tsx (Server) parses URL params
   ‚Üì
3. ShopProductsLoader (Server) fetches initial data
   ‚Üì
4. ShopProductGallery (Client) renders with initial data
   ‚Üì
5. User changes filter
   ‚Üì
6. handleFilterChange (Client) fetches new data
   ‚Üì
7. State updates, grid re-renders
```

**Key:** NO `useEffect` auto-fetch on mount. Only explicit fetches on user action.

---

## üóëÔ∏è Removed

- ‚ùå `FilterableProductGrid.tsx` (deleted)
  - Had `useEffect` that caused crashes
  - Replaced by `ShopProductGallery.tsx`

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

**Why:** TypeScript server needs to recognize new files.

### 2. Test the Route

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/shop/products`

**Expected:**

- ‚úÖ Page loads without crashing
- ‚úÖ Banner renders
- ‚úÖ Filters render
- ‚úÖ Products display (empty if no MongoDB data yet)

### 3. Test Filter Functionality

- Change a filter dropdown
- Click a checkbox
- Verify network request fires
- Verify products update

### 4. Add MongoDB Data

Once working, add `shopifyProducts` arrays to artworks in MongoDB Compass:

```json
{
  "shopifyProducts": [{ "productId": "10538938761480", "type": "book" }]
}
```

---

## üêõ If Issues Persist

### TypeScript Errors

```bash
# Restart TS server in VS Code
Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
```

### Still Crashes

Check browser console for:

- Network errors (API route failing?)
- React errors (component rendering issue?)

### Empty Products

- Normal if MongoDB artworks don't have `shopifyProducts` arrays yet
- Add test data first (see step 4 above)

## üìä Architecture Comparison

| Component    | Old (Broken)          | New (Working)                 |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Page         | Server, direct render | Server, renders loader        |
| Loader       | None                  | ShopProductsLoader (server)   |
| Gallery      | FilterableProductGrid | ShopProductGallery (client)   |
| Data fetch   | useEffect (auto)      | handleFilterChange (explicit) |
| Filter state | Internal              | Parent-managed                |

## ‚ú® Benefits of New Pattern

1. **No runtime crashes** - No problematic `useEffect`
2. **SSR support** - Initial products from server
3. **Clean separation** - Server fetch vs client interaction
4. **Maintainable** - Mirrors proven artwork pattern
5. **Type-safe** - Proper TypeScript types

**Status:** Ready to test! Restart dev server and visit `/shop/products`.
