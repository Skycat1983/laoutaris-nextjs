**Fundamental Principles**

- Write clean, simple, readable code
- Reliability is the top priority - if you can't make it reliable, don't build it
- Implement features in the simplest possible way
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2â€“3 reasoning paragraphs.
- Leave ego aside when debugging and fixing errors. You do not know anything.

**Error Fixing**

- Consider multiple possible causes before deciding. Do not jump to conclusions.
- Explain the problem in plain English
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- Always verify the fix
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search to find the latest up-to-date information

**Building Process**

- Understand requirements completely before starting
- Plan the next steps in detail
- Break the problem down into smaller parts
- Focus on the most important part
- Build incrementally
