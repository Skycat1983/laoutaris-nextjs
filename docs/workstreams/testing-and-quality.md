# Testing And Quality Workstream

Status: Planned

Goal: build a dependable verification baseline that supports production
refactoring without turning every change into a manual QA pass.

## Depends On

- [Testing runbook](../runbooks/testing.md)
- [Routes and API architecture](../architecture/routes-and-api.md)
- [Production-readiness risks](../risks/production-readiness.md)

## Blocks

- Safe refactoring across shared modules.
- Production release confidence.
- CI readiness.

## Related Code Areas

- `jest.config.js`
- `jest.setup.js`
- `__tests__/`
- `package.json`
- Any route, transform, helper, or component touched by refactors.

## Current Facts

- Existing scripts are `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and
  `npm run dev`.
- Jest uses `next/jest` with `jsdom`.
- Current tests are mostly utilities plus a small home view integration test.
- No dedicated end-to-end script is present in `package.json`.
- Project owner reports testing has been attempted but is not yet successfully
  established as a reliable production-readiness practice.
- A-006 baseline: `npm test` passed with 9 suites and 95 tests, `npm run lint`
  passed, and `npm run build` passed only after approved network access.
- A-006 coverage probe across `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` reported 1.78% statements and
  1.76% lines, with no coverage gate.
- The build is currently environment-sensitive because it fetches Google Fonts
  and performs live MongoDB/data work during static generation.
- A-002, A-003, and A-004 added concrete missing coverage for route status
  contracts, route/fetcher parity, DB ownership checks, validation/transform
  outputs, credentials role persistence, stable ownership helpers, and
  representative user/admin APIs.
- A-007 found deployment smoke checks are manual and not backed by a script or
  evidence checklist.

## Backlog

- Establish which commands must pass before each handoff and document
  environment limitations for build checks.
- Add API contract tests for one representative public, user, and admin route
  group before broad refactors.
- Add tests for shared response helpers, body-level status cleanup, and
  unauthenticated/forbidden JSON 401/403 behavior.
- Add a route/fetcher parity check that compares `src/lib/api/**/fetchers.ts`
  paths and methods against exported handlers under `src/app/api/v2`.
- Add a DB ownership check for MongoDB-backed route handlers and server actions
  once the shared wrapper/service pattern is chosen.
- Add auth/route-protection tests around middleware utilities and high-risk
  session helpers.
- Add credentials admin, credentials non-admin, OAuth user, middleware admin,
  and representative user/admin API route-guard tests.
- Add transform/schema tests for field matrix decisions, profile/comment/enquiry
  DTOs, admin write DTOs, blog `readTime`, collection `firstArtworkId`,
  user/comment ownership state, and artwork image sanitization.
- Replace or supplement the mocked Home integration test with a test that
  exercises the intended production component boundary.
- Add Shopify transformation, product link, product detail, and public shop API
  tests before commerce implementation work.
- Add SSR/server-loader tests that do not require a live `localhost:3000`
  server.
- Add a documented coverage command and targeted thresholds for route guards,
  transforms, API helpers, and Shopify/data contracts before considering a
  repo-wide threshold.
- Convert deployment smoke checks into a scripted smoke suite or precise
  evidence-based manual checklist before production launch.
- Isolate or document Google Fonts and live MongoDB dependencies for CI build
  verification.
- Reduce expected test/build noise by gating debug logs and expected
  error-path logging.
- Add CI documentation after the chosen checks are stable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every production-critical workstream lists its required verification commands.
- Test failures are documented with owner and next action.
- New refactors include focused tests when behavior changes.
- Build and test commands can be run by a new agent without extra context.

## Verification

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## Progress

- Documentation scaffold created.
- 2026-05-14: A-006 baseline findings reconciled into
  `docs/audits/findings-register.md`, production risks, the testing runbook, and
  this backlog.
- 2026-05-14: Reconciled A-002, A-003, A-004, and A-007 testing gaps into
  F-016 plus related converted findings and this backlog.

## Next Agent Action

Stabilize the verification baseline by adding shared route response/auth tests,
a route/fetcher parity check, and transform contract tests for the first
A-002/A-003 implementation slice.
