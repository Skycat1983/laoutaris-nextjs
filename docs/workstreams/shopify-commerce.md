# Shopify Commerce Workstream

Status: Planned

Goal: make Shopify-backed artwork, print, and book sales reliable enough for
production while preserving MongoDB as the archive source of truth.

## Depends On

- [Shopify commerce architecture](../architecture/shopify-commerce.md)
- [Routes and API architecture](../architecture/routes-and-api.md)
- [Shopify operations runbook](../runbooks/shopify-operations.md)
- [Production-readiness risks](../risks/production-readiness.md)
- Historical notes in [archive](../archive/README.md)

## Blocks

- Public shop launch.
- Product detail purchase flow.
- Admin workflow for linking artworks to Shopify products.

## Related Code Areas

- `src/app/shop/page.tsx`
- `src/app/shop/products/page.tsx`
- `src/app/shop/products/[productHandle]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/api/v2/public/shop/products/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v2/public/shop/products/[productId]/route.ts`
- `src/lib/api/shopify/`
- `src/lib/data/types/shopTypes.ts`
- `src/lib/data/types/shopifyTypes.ts`
- `src/components/compositions/ShopProductGallery.tsx`
- `src/components/modules/filters/ShopFilters.tsx`
- `src/components/modules/cards/ProductCard.tsx`

## Current Facts

- Product listing and product detail routes already exist under `/shop`.
- Shopify is accessed through the Storefront GraphQL API.
- MongoDB artwork documents store minimal Shopify references via
  `shopifyProducts`.
- The current canonical product link shape stores numeric Shopify product IDs,
  not full Shopify GIDs.
- Historical docs describe prior shop crashes caused by barrel imports from
  client components.
- Product route URLs should use Shopify handles:
  `/shop/products/[productHandle]`.

## Backlog

- Confirm the current shop routes compile and load with empty, partial, and
  populated Shopify data.
- Audit the product listing API for error shape, pagination behavior, filter
  correctness, and failed Shopify fetch behavior.
- Confirm the product detail route handles original artworks, prints, books, and
  missing linked MongoDB artwork.
- Define the admin linking workflow for original, print, and book product links.
- Decide whether Shopify cart or checkout handoff is in scope for the first
  production release.
- Add focused tests for product transformation, link helpers, and API behavior.
- Move useful root shop notes into architecture and runbook docs, then archive
  or remove the root notes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `/shop/products` renders without runtime crashes.
- Product listing filters and sorting have tested behavior.
- `/shop/products/[productHandle]` handles not found, unavailable, and partially
  linked products gracefully.
- Artwork pages can show sale links without fetching stale product data from
  MongoDB.
- Shopify secrets are documented as environment variables only.
- Historical shop implementation notes are no longer required for onboarding.

## Verification

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

Add targeted tests as shop behavior is hardened.

## Progress

- Documentation scaffold created.
- Historical shop notes identified and indexed in `docs/archive/README.md`.

## Next Agent Action

Audit the live shop route and public shop API against
[../architecture/shopify-commerce.md](../architecture/shopify-commerce.md), then
update this brief with confirmed defects and the first implementation task.
