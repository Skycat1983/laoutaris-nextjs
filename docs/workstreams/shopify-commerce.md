# Shopify Commerce Workstream

Status: Planned

Goal: make Shopify-backed artwork, print, and book sales reliable enough for
production while preserving MongoDB as the archive source of truth.

## Depends On

- [Shopify commerce architecture](../architecture/shopify-commerce.md)
- [Routes and API architecture](../architecture/routes-and-api.md)
- [Shopify operations runbook](../runbooks/shopify-operations.md)
- [Production-readiness risks](../risks/production-readiness.md)
- Historical notes in [archive](../archive/README.md)

## Blocks

- Public shop launch.
- Product detail purchase flow.
- Admin workflow for linking artworks to Shopify products.

## Current Facts

- Product listing and product detail routes already exist under `/shop`.
- Shopify is accessed through the Storefront GraphQL API.
- MongoDB artwork documents store minimal Shopify references via
  `shopifyProducts`.
- The current canonical product link shape stores numeric Shopify product IDs,
  not full Shopify GIDs.
- Historical docs describe prior shop crashes caused by barrel imports from
  client components.
- Product route URLs should use Shopify handles:
  `/shop/products/[productHandle]`.
- A-001 found product detail linked artwork fetching, checkout scope, admin
  linking, credential hygiene, product ID validation, filters, pagination,
  sorting, transform coverage, and API envelope consistency are not
  production-ready.
- A-015 independently confirmed the product-detail linked artwork fetch uses a
  non-existent `/api/artworks/:id` path.

## Backlog

- Decide first-release checkout handoff: hide purchase controls, link to
  Shopify-hosted product/checkout, or implement Shopify cart/checkout with
  variant selection.
- Fix `/shop/products/[productHandle]` linked artwork fetching by using the
  canonical public artwork route envelope or a server-side data helper.
- Define the admin linking workflow for original, print, and book product links,
  including numeric ID/type validation and duplicate prevention.
- Remove credential-like Shopify values from source comments, verify whether any
  exposed value was real, and rotate if needed.
- Add shared Shopify product ID normalization and audit existing data for legacy
  GID-style values.
- Standardize shop product API envelopes and carry product type, tags, variant
  IDs, availability, and description fields needed by product detail.
- Remove or implement visible color/dimension filters and placeholder
  pagination.
- Sort shop products on explicit product/link metadata instead of title
  keywords.
- Add focused tests for product transformation, link helpers, API behavior,
  product detail artwork context, filters, sorting, and pagination.
- Move useful root shop notes into architecture and runbook docs, then archive
  or remove the root notes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `/shop/products` renders without runtime crashes.
- Product listing filters and sorting have tested behavior.
- `/shop/products/[productHandle]` handles not found, unavailable, and partially
  linked products gracefully.
- Artwork pages can show sale links without fetching stale product data from
  MongoDB.
- Shopify secrets are documented as environment variables only.
- Historical shop implementation notes are no longer required for onboarding.

## Verification

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

Add targeted tests as shop behavior is hardened.

## Progress

- Documentation scaffold created.
- Historical shop notes identified and indexed in `docs/archive/README.md`.
- 2026-05-14: A-001 and overlapping A-015 findings reconciled into
  `docs/audits/findings-register.md`, production risks, and this backlog.

## Next Agent Action

Resolve the checkout handoff and admin linking workflow decisions, then fix
product-detail linked artwork fetching and shop API envelope consistency before
hardening filters, pagination, sorting, and tests.
